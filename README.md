# Inference machine
 Inference machine, developed for a university's project.

In this repository, you will find the source code, a  report of the project, and a few slides which present the project.

For the application, we have been inspired by Minecraft, because in our game, you have to move map by map and collect resources,  to craft new items to collect more.
